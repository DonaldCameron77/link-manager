link-manager stores links with (potentially) multiple attached tags on a
per-user basis.  This service supports a web front end (in a separate repo ...
implementation has yet to begin as of mid-April 2019).

There will be an associated web front end which communicates with the
link-manager service.  Once logged in, the user will see the most recently
stored links with their titles, descriptions, and tags (if any).  Clicking a
link entry will cause the link target to be loaded.

Unlike Instapaper and Pocket, the material from the link page will not be
edited or scrubbed of ads or other distractions. And unlike delicio.us,
there will not be social features (at least not at first release) - each
user has a private set of links and tags.

If the user searches for links by tag(s), then the list of links displayed will
be filtered on the basis of matching tags.  These can be sorted by
most-recently-saved, by date associated with the page, and possibly other
criteria.
